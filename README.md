TODO List Application

Description:
This is a simple TODO list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, mark as complete, and delete tasks, providing an organized way to manage daily tasks. No backend is required, as tasks are stored in the browser's local storage to persist between sessions.
 

Features:
- **Add New Task**: Users can add a task with a title and description.
- **Mark Complete/Incomplete**: Toggle each task’s completion status with a checkbox.
- **Edit and Delete Tasks**: Users can edit existing tasks or delete them if they’re no longer needed.
- **Filter Tasks**: Users can filter tasks to view "All," "Completed," or "Pending" items.
- **Local Storage Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage to maintain them across page reloads.

Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structures the application's layout.
- **CSS**: Styles the TODO list for an intuitive and visually pleasing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the application's functionality, including adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks, as well as interacting with local storage.

 Usage:
- **Open the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the TODO List.
